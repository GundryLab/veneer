# Veneer
Veneer is a web-based bioinformatic tool to rapidly and automatically assess and curate data from cell surface capture (CSC; e.g., ÂµCSC, autoCSC, classic CSC) and related workflows (i.e., N-glycoprotein or N-glycopeptide enrichment strategies including ligand receptor capture and methods that incorporate, biocytin hydrazide, aminooxy biotin, and alkoxyamine-PEG4-biotin) that release captured glycopeptides by PNGase F treatment. Veneer employs a categorization scheme that first assigns levels of evidence (1, 2, 3) and then designates proteins to cell surface protein assignment tiers (high, medium, low, and zero. Veneer provides enhanced functional annotations contributing added biological insights with high relevance for cell surface proteins.
